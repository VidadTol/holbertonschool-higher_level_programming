# General 

### Why Python programming is awesome?
Python programming is awesome because of its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It has a vast standard library and an active community, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experts.

### Whatâ€™s the difference between errors and exceptions?
Errors are issues in the code that prevent it from running correctly. Exceptions are a subset of errors that the program can catch and handle, allowing the control flow to be maintained.

### What are exceptions and how to use them?
Exceptions are abnormal events that occur during the execution of a program and interrupt the normal flow of instructions. To use exceptions in Python, we employ `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

### When do we need to use exceptions?
Exceptions should be used when we need to handle unforeseen or abnormal situations in the program, such as input/output errors, calculation errors, or network connection errors.

### How to correctly handle an exception?
To handle an exception correctly, we use a try block to `wrap` the code that might cause an exception, and one or more except blocks to handle specific exceptions. A `finally` block can be used to execute cleanup code, whether an exception occurred or not.

### Whatâ€™s the purpose of catching exceptions?
The purpose of catching exceptions is to allow the program to continue running even if an error occurs, providing a mechanism to manage these errors in a controlled and informative way.

### How to raise a builtin exception?
To raise a builtin exception, we use the raise statement followed by the exception name.

### When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception?
We need to implement a clean-up action after an exception when there are resources to release or states to reset, such as closing files, releasing memory, or resetting variables.
