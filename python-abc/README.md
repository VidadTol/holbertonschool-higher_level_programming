# Introduction:
Welcome to this set of exercises aimed at honing your understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Through these exercises, you will delve into abstract classes, interfaces, duck typing, and subclassing standard base classes among other crucial OOP concepts. By the end of these exercises, you should be proficient in employing OOP principles to design, implement, and test Python programs.

# Learning Objectives:
`Abstract Classes`: Understand and apply abstract classes to define common interfaces while enforcing certain levels of class completeness.  
`Interfaces and Duck Typing`: Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing to ensure that objects adhere to a specific contract or protocol.  
`Subclassing Standard Base Classes`: Learn to extend standard base classes like lists, dictionaries, and iterators to create custom data structures with specialized behavior.  
`Method Overriding`: Employ method overriding to alter or enhance the behavior of base class methods.  
`Multiple Inheritance`: Understand and apply multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes.  
`Mixins`: Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes.

# Exercices

| Filename | Objective |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses` | Create an abstract class named Animal using the ABC package with an abstract method called sound. Create two subclasses of Animal: Dog and Cat. Implement the sound method in each subclass to return the strings “Bark” and “Meow” respectively.|
| `1. My list` | Write a class MyList that inherits from list. |
| `2. Exact same object` | Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.|
| `3. Same class or inherit from` | Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.|
| `4. Only sub class of` | Write a function that returns True if an object inherits from a specified class; otherwise False.|
| `5. Geometry module` | Write an empty class BaseGeometry.|
| `6. Improve Geometry` | Public instance method that raises an Exception with the message `area() is not implemented`.|
