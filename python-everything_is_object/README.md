# General

`What is an object ?`  
An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior.

`What is the difference between a class and an object or instance ?`  
A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object or instance is a concrete representation created from the class.

`What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object ?`  
Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation, whereas mutable objects can.

`What is a reference ?`  
 A reference is a memory link that points to an object.

`What is an assignment ?`  
 An assignment binds a variable name to an object.

`What is an alias ?`  
An alias occurs when two or more variables refer to the same object.

`How to know if two variables are identical ?`  
Use the equality operator == to check if two variables are identical in value.

`How to know if two variables are linked to the same object ?` 
Use the identity operator is to check if two variables are linked to the same object.

`How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation) ?`   
The function id() displays the identifier of a variable, corresponding to its memory address in CPython.

`What is mutable and immutable ?`  
Mutable objects can be changed, while immutable objects cannot.

`What are the built-in mutable types ?` 
Built-in mutable types include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

`What are the built-in immutable types ?`  
Built-in immutable types include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

`How does Python pass variables to functions ?`  
Python passes variables to functions by reference. Changes to mutable objects affect the original, while changes to immutable objects create new ones.
