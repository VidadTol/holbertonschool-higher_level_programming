# Introduction:
Welcome to our exploration of marshaling and serialization, two fundamental concepts in computer science that enable the efficient storage and transmission of data. In this programming project, you will delve deep into how data can be transformed and communicated between different parts of a system, or even across different systems. This project is designed to enhance your understanding and practical skills in handling data in real-world applications.

### What is Marshaling?
Marshaling is the process of transforming memory objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network. It involves packaging complex objects and their attributes into a simpler, often binary, format. This is crucial in scenarios such as remote procedure calls, where objects need to be represented in a standard format across different computing platforms.

### What is Serialization?
Serialization, closely related to marshaling, specifically involves converting data structures or object states into a format that can be easily saved to a file or sent over a network. The main goal of serialization is to preserve the state of an object, so it can be recreated in an identical state elsewhere. This becomes essential in developing applications that require data persistence, distributed computing, and data sharing between different software components.


# Learning Objectives:
- Articulate the differences and similarities between marshaling and serialization.
- Implement serialization in a practical programming task.
- Understand how serialized data can be used in web applications, databases, and network communications.
- Evaluate the performance implications of different serialization formats, like JSON, XML, and binary formats.


# Exercices

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. Basic Serialization` | Create a basic serialization module to convert a Python dictionary to a JSON file and recreate the dictionary from the JSON file. |
| `1. Pickling Custom Classes` | Create a CustomObject class with attributes name, age, is_student, and a display method to display its attributes, using the pickle module to serialize and deserialize objects. |
| `2. Converting CSV Data to JSON Format` | Learn how to read data in CSV format and convert it to JSON using serialization techniques.|
| `3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML` |The exercise consists of learning how to serialize and deserialize objects using XML instead of JSON, by defining two main functions (serialize_to_xml and deserialize_from_xml) to convert between a Python dictionary and an XML file. |
